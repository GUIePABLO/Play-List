    <h4>Wooh Oh oooh this is world war me
        <br>
        Wooh oh oooh I will never find peace,
        <br>
        I'm the only enemy
        <br>
        I'm the king of doubt,
        <br>
        I fight out all on the inside
        <br>
        I'm the poster child of denial,
        <br>
        There is nothing I can't hide
        <br>
        I'm punching holes in walls because,
        <br>
        I let them build up way too long, sabotage
        <br>
        Everything I ever had,
        <br>
        <br>
        And now I'm seeing red but,
        <br>
        There is no one else to blame but,
        <br>
        The voices in my head
        <br>
        Wooh oh oooh this is world war me
        <br>
        Wooh oh oooh I will never find peace
        <br>
        I look into the mirror and I hate what I've become
        <br>
        'Cause I'm the only casualty from damage that I've done
        <br>
        I'm the only enemy in world war me
        <br>
        I know you tried to show me the light,
        <br>
        I feed on the darkness
        <br>
        I've lost control, I'm down in a hole,
        <br>
        I'm broken and helpless
        <br>
        The noose is getting tight,
        <br>
        So tight, will I make it through the night
        <br>
        It's time to surrender to myself
        <br>
        And crawl out of this hell,
        <br>
        The battle is in my head, there is nobody else
        <br>
        Wooh oh oooh this is world war me
        <br>
        Wooh oh oooh I will never find peace
        <br>
        I look into the mirror and I hate what I've become
        <br>
        'Cause I'm the only casualty from damage that I've done
        <br>
        I'm the only enemy in world war me
        <br>
        How do you runaway, when you're the enemy
        <br>
        No, there is no way out,
        <br>
        Nothing is gonna save me now
        <br>
        Wooh oh oooh this is world war me
        <br>
        Wooh oh oooh I will never be free
        <br>
        Wooh oh oooh this is world war me
        <br>
        Wooh oh oooh I will never find peace
        <br>
        I look into the mirror and
        <br>
        I hate what I've become
        <br>
        'Cause I'm the only casualty
        <br>
        From damage that I've done
        <br>
        I'm the only enemy in world war me, world war me
