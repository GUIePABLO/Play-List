        <h4>(Look out for yourself)<br>
            I wake up to the sounds of the silence that allows<br>
            For my mind to run around, with my ear up to the ground<br>
            I'm searching to behold the stories that are told<br>
            When my back is to the world that was smiling when I turned<br>
            <br>
            Tell you: You're the greatest<br>
            But once you turn, they hate us<br>
            <br>
            Oh, the misery<br>
            Everybody wants to be my enemy<br>
            Spare the sympathy<br>
            Everybody wants to be my enemy-y-y-y-y<br>
            (Look out for yourself)<br>
            My enemy-y-y-y-y<br>
            (Look out for yourself)<br>
            But I'm ready<br>
            <br>
            Your words up on the wall as you'rе praying for my fall<br>
            And the laughter in thе halls<br>
            And the names that I've been called<br>
            I stack it in my mind and I'm waiting for the time<br>
            When I show you what it's like to be words spit in a mic<br>
            <br>
            Tell you: You're the greatest<br>
            But once you turn, they hate us<br>
            <br>
            Oh, the misery<br>
            Everybody wants to be my enemy<br>
            Spare the sympathy<br>
            Everybody wants to be my enemy-y-y-y-y<br>
            (Look out for yourself)<br>
            My enemy-y-y-y-y (yeah)<br>
            (Look out for yourself)<br>
            <br>
            Uh, look, okay<br>
            I'm hoping that somebody pray for me<br>
            I'm praying that somebody hope for me<br>
            I'm staying where nobody 'posed to be<br>
            P-p-posted, being a wreck of emotions<br>
            Ready to go whenever just let me know<br>
            The road is long so put the pedal into the floor<br>
            The enemy's on my trail, my energy unavailable<br>
            I'ma tell 'em: Hasta luego<br>
            They wanna plot on my trot to the top<br>
            I've been outta shape, thinking out the box I'm an astronaut<br>
            I blasted off the planet rock to cause catastrophe<br>
            And it matters more because I had it not<br>
            Had I thought about wreaking havoc on an opposition<br>
            Kinda shockin' they wanted a static with precision I'm automatic quaterback<br>
            I ain't talking sacking, pack it, pack it up, I don't panic<br>
            Batter, batter up, who the baddest?<br>
            It don't matter 'cause we at ya throat<br>
            <br>
            Everybody wants to be my enemy<br>
            Spare the sympathy<br>
            Everybody wants to be my enemy<br>
            Oh, the misery<br>
            Everybody wants to be my enemy<br>
            Spare the sympathy<br>
            Everybody wants to be my enemy<br>
            <br>
            Pray it away, I swear<br>
            I'll never be a saint, no way<br>
            My enemy<br>
            Pray it away, I swear<br>
            I'll never be a saint<br>
            (Look out for yourself)
