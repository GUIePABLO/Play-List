        <h3>Hey-o, here comes the danger up in this club<br>
            When we get started, man, we ain't gon' stop<br>
            We gon' turn it out 'til it gets too hot<br>
            Everybody sing, hey-o<br>
            Tell 'em turn it up 'til they can't no more<br>
            Let's get this thing shakin' like a disco ball<br>
            This is your last warning, a courtesy call<br>
            Hey-o, here comes the danger up in this club<br>
            When we get started, man, we ain't gon' stop<br>
            We gon' turn it out 'til it gets too hot<br>
            Everybody sing, hey-o<br>
            Tell 'em turn it up 'til they can't no more<br>
            Let's get this thing shakin' like a disco ball<br>
            This is your last warning, a courtesy call<br>
            I am not afraid of the storm that comes my way<br>
            When it hits it shakes me to the core<br>
            And makes me stronger than before<br>
            It's not a question about trust<br>
            But will you stand with us?<br>
            Can you feel it?<br>
            Make it real and<br>
            I think it might wash away tonight<br>
            Awaken from this never ending fight<br>
            It takes more than meets the eye<br>
            This war we're fighting it's not just rotting<br>
            Hey-o, here comes the danger up in this club<br>
            When we get started, man, we ain't gon' stop<br>
            We gon' turn it out 'til it gets too hot<br>
            Everybody sing, hey-o<br>
            Tell 'em turn it up 'til they can't no more<br>
            Let's get this thing shakin' like a disco ball<br>
            This is your last warning, a courtesy call<br>
            There's a rumble in the floor<br>
            So get prepared for war<br>
            When it hits it'll knock you to the ground<br>
            When it shakes up everything around<br>
            But survival is a must<br>
            So will you stand with us?<br>
            Can you feel it?<br>
            Make it real and (make me feel it)<br>
            I think it might wash away tonight<br>
            Awaken from this never ending fight<br>
            It takes more than meets the eye<br>
            This war we're fighting it's not just rotting<br>
